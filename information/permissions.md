# Permissions



The `permissions` command is used to verify whether the necessary permissions are in place. It provides feedback on:

* **Required Permissions:** Indicates what permissions are needed.
* **Current Status:** Confirms if all necessary permissions are already granted.

It lists all the required permissions and puts a ✅ or an ❌ depending if the bot has it or not.
