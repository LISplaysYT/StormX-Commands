# IQ

The `/iq` command provides a fun way to calculate your IQ. Users can invoke the command in the following ways:

* **Usage:**
  * `/iq`
    * Generates a random IQ number for the user who initiated the command.
  *   `/iq user:<user>`

      * Generates a random IQ number for the specified user.

      **Note:** The IQ value is purely random and should not be taken as an actual measure of intelligence. Enjoy it as a lighthearted prank!
